# MongoDB Atlas CLI Security Improvements

## Security Issues Addressed

The security scanner detected hardcoded database credentials in your codebase. These included connection strings with usernames and passwords in:

1. Test files (`test_mongodb_atlas.py`)
2. Log files (`mongodb_atlas.log`)
3. Potentially in the source code itself

Even though these are test credentials, storing any credentials in repositories is considered a security risk.

## Implemented Security Improvements

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Credentials in Tests

- Created a helper function `check_connection_string()` to validate connection strings without hardcoding credentials
- Replaced hardcoded assertions with pattern matching that doesn't contain actual credentials
- Used consistent test constants instead of literal values

### 2. Added Credential Masking in the Main Code

- Created a `mask_connection_string()` function that replaces passwords with asterisks in logs
- Updated all logging to use the masking function when displaying connection strings
- Modified `print` statements to show masked connection strings in CLI output

### 3. Made Credentials Configurable

- Added environment variable support for database credentials
- Use `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` environment variables with defaults
- Added a comment about not hardcoding passwords in production code

### 4. Updated Log File Handling

- Added log files to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being committed
- Added clear logging patterns to distinguish between sensitive and non-sensitive information

## Next Steps for Security

1. **Remove existing log files from Git history**:
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
   "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch mongodb_atlas.log atlas_operations.log" \
   --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

2. **Consider using a secrets management solution** for your application:
   - AWS Secrets Manager
   - HashiCorp Vault
   - Azure Key Vault

3. **Implement credential rotation** for any exposed credentials

4. **Set up pre-commit hooks** to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   # Add a .pre-commit-config.yaml file with appropriate hooks
   ```

## Example Usage with Enhanced Security

```bash
# Set database credentials in environment (not in code)
export DB_USER=custom_user
export DB_PASSWORD=secure_password

# Then run your commands
python mongodb_atlas.py create-free-cluster --project-id PROJECT_ID --name mycluster
```

## Testing with Security in Mind

When writing tests that involve credentials:

1. Use environment variables or test fixtures
2. Use regex or pattern matching instead of exact credentials
3. Mock external dependencies to avoid real connections
4. Use clearly fake credentials like `test-user`/`test-pass` instead of ones that appear real

This approach maintains test functionality while keeping your codebase secure.
